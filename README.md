# AngularJS - Countries & Capitals

An Angular app that allows users to search and visualize data about countries and capital cities using the API provided by [geonames.org](http://www.geonames.org/)

Built using AngularJS, Bootstrap, HTML5 & CSS3.

It will consist of three views, a home page which links to the countries list, Countries list view to see all the countries and summary displayed in a table, and Country detail view which shows detailed information about a country.

An animated loading state is displayed when AJAX calls are being made for Countries list view and Country detail view.
